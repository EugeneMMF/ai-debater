# Python AI Debater

## About

- This program offers a CLI interface of a debate between AI and itself.
- The AI model used in this case is Gemini Flash 1.5.

## To Use
- To use it I advice the creation of a Python3 virtual environment and installing the requirements in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
- You can then run the app [debate.py](./debate.py).
- It takes some CLI arguments. You can use the command `python3 debate.py -h` or `python3 debate.py --help` to see how to use the CLI arguments.
